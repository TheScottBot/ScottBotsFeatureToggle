# ScottBotsFeatureToggle
Code to reduce indentation and as a result the cyclomatic complexity of an application when using toggles

This code uses generic types call any method if toggled on. 

This is currently in a bare bones structure as I haven't had to implement any other parsers. In practice this could parse the toggle out of whatever is needed
